***Types of area networks:***
>**Local Area Network (LAN)**
>>The group of computers and devices are connected together by a switch, or stack of switches, using a private addressing scheme as defined by the TCP/IP protocol. 
>>
>>Routers are found at the boundary of a LAN, connecting them to the larger WAN.
>>
>>Data transmits at a very fast rate as the number of computers linked are limited.Early LAN’s had data rates in the 4 to 16 Mbps range. Today, speeds are normally 100 or 1000 Mbps.
>>
>>The connections must be high speed and relatively inexpensive hardware
>>
>>LANs cover smaller geographical area (Size is limited to a few kilometers) and are privately owned. It covers a short distance, and so the error and noise are minimized.
>>
>>LAN is easy to design and maintain.
>>
>>A Communication medium used for LAN has twisted pair cables and coaxial cables
>>
>>The smallest LAN may only use two computers, while larger LANs can accommodate thousands of computers.
>>
>>A LAN typically relies mostly on wired connections for increased speed and security, but wireless connections can also be part of a LAN.
>>
>>The fault tolerance of a LAN is more and there is less congestion in this network.
>>
>**Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**
>>covers a larger area than that of a LAN and smaller area as compared to WAN
>>
>>Connects two or more computers that are apart but resides in the same or different cities. It covers a large geographical area and may serve as an ISP (Internet Service Provider).
>>
>>Is designed for customers who need a high-speed connectivity.Speeds of MAN ranges in terms of Mbps.
>>
>>It’s hard to design and maintain a Metropolitan Area Network.
>>
>>It is costly and may or may not be owned by a single organization
>>
>>The data transfer rate and the propagation delay of MAN is moderate.
>>
>>Devices used for transmission of data through MAN are: Modem and Wire/Cable.
>>
>>The fault tolerance of a MAN is less and also there is more congestion in the network.
>>
>**Wide Area Network (WAN)**
>>Computer network that extends over a large geographical area, although it might be confined within the bounds of a state or country.
>>
>>A WAN could be a connection of LAN connecting to other LAN’s 
>>
>>The technology is high speed and relatively expensive.
>>
>>Types of WAN:
>>>Switched WAN
>>>
>>>Point-to-Point WAN
>>
>>Difficult to design and maintain.
>>
>>The fault tolerance of a WAN is less and there is more congestion in the network
>>
>>Communication medium -  PSTN or Satellite Link.
>>
>>Due to long distance transmission, the noise and error tend to be more in WAN.
>>
>>WAN’s data rate is slow about a 10th LAN’s speed, speed ranges from few Kbps to Mbps
>>
>>Propagation delay is one of the biggest problems faced here
>>
>>Devices used for transmission of data through WAN are: Optic wires, Microwaves and Satellites.
>
>**PAN (Personal Area Network)**
>>A personal area network (PAN) is a computer network organized around an individual for personal use only. They typically involve a computer, phone, printer, tablet, or some other device like a PDA.
>>
>>they transmit information between devices that are nearby instead of sending that same data through a LAN or WAN before it reaches something that's already within reach.
>>
>>Personal area networks can be wireless or constructed with cables.
>>
>>Wireless personal area networks cover a range of a few centimeters up to around 10 meters (33 feet) / With Bluetooth, such a setup could be as large as 100 meters (330 feet). These networks are a particular type (or subset) of local area networks that support one person instead of a group.
>>
>>PANs can still access the internet under certain conditions. For example, a device within a PAN can connect to a LAN which has access to the internet, which is itself a WAN.
>>
>>a WPAN is considered a secure network. However, just like with WLANs and other network types, hackers can still access unsecured PANs.
>
>**SAN (Storage Area Network)**
>
>**EPN (Enterprise Private Network)**
>
>**VPN (Virtual Private Network)**

***Ad Hoc network (connection within 100 meters)***
>An ad hoc network is one that is spontaneously formed when devices connect and communicate with each other. / connection is temporary.(temporary type of Local Area Network (LAN)-f you set up an ad hoc network permanently, it becomes a LAN.)
>
>In ad hoc mode, you can set up a wireless connection directly to another computer or device without having to connect to a Wi-Fi access point or router.
>
>Users can also employ an ad hoc network to access the internet, as long as the hosting device can access the internet. This might be useful if only one small area of a location can access the internet, but multiple people need to get online.
>
>Due to the nature of an ad hoc connection not needing an existing infrastructure to sustain the network, it's entirely decentralized and is considered a peer-to-peer network.
>>If cyber-attackers get within signal range, they will generally be able to connect to a wireless ad hoc network and, therefore, to the device.
>>
>>Users cannot disable their SSID broadcast ( Service Set Identifier-function which is performed by Access Point that broadcasts its name by default /SSID basically indicates the name of your router or network) in ad hoc mode, meaning that the network name cannot be hidden if users are in a public place.
>
>Ad hoc networks can be classified into several types depending upon the nature of their applications.
>>1. Mobile ad hoc network (MANETs) ( wireless adhoc network / adhoc wireless network)
>>> Consist of set of mobile nodes connected wirelessly in a self configured, self healing network without having a fixed infrastructure. MANET nodes are free to move randomly as the network topology changes frequently.
>>
>>2. Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs)
>>>Enable effective communication with another vehicle or with the roadside equipments.Intelligent vehicular ad hoc networks(InVANETs) deals with another vehicle or with the roadside euipments.
>>
>>3. Smart phone ad hoc networks (SPANs)
>>>To create peer-to-peer network without relying on cellular carrier networks, wireless access points or traditional network infrasture.Here peer can join or leave the network without destroying it.
>>
>>4. Internet based Mobile Ad hoc Network (iMANETs) –
>>>It supports internet protocols such as TCP/UDP and IP. To link mobile nodes and establish routes distributed and automatically.
>>
>>5. Military or Tactical MANETs –
>>>This is used by the military units. Emphasis on data rate, real time demand, fast re-routing during mobility, security, radio range, etc.
>>
>>6. Flying Ad hoc Network (FANETs) –
>>>This is composed of unmanned aerial vehicle (commonly known as drone). Provides links to remote areas and mobility.

What's the difference between a Personal Area Network (PAN) and an ad-hoc network?

From memory. A PAN is more like Bluetooth, short range low bandwidth network capable of connecting your mobile or laptop to printers, speakers and such. An ad hoc network usually refers to the 802.11 wireless networks where an endpoint can host the network instead of the more typical access point / wireless router. When I set my mobile phone to hotspot mode it becomes an ad hoc wireless network provider. My computer can connect to the hot spot via WiFi or via Bluetooth.

***Transmission Medium***

***Types of Network Topology***
>Refers to the layout af a computer network.
>>Physical topology : layout of the network media that shows the interconnections of the devices on the network.
>>
>>Logical topology : emphasis on the manner in which data is transmitted between network nodes.
>
>**Mesh Topology**
>>In mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via particular channel.
>>
>>Ports that is required by each device is : N-1
>>
>>Total number of dedicated links required to connect them is : n to C to 2 i.e. N(N-1)/2
>>
>>ADVANTAGES:
>>>It is robust.
>>>
>>>Fault is diagnosed easily. Data is reliable
>>>
>>>Provides security and privacy.
>>
>>DISAVANT:
>>>Installation and configuration is difficult.
>>>
>>>Suitable for less number of devices
>>>
>>>Cost of maintenance is high.
>
>**Star Topology**
>>All the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable.This hub is the central node and all others nodes are connected to the central node.
>>
>> No of ports: 1 per device
>>
>>Dedicated links : 1 per device
>>
>>Passive : not intelligent hub such as broadcasting devices.
>>
>>Active : the hub can be intelligent. Active hubs have repeaters in them.
>>
>>ADAVNTAGE:
>>>Easy to set up.
>>
>>DISADVANT
>>>If the concentrator (hub) on which the whole topology relies fails, the whole system will crash down.
>>>
>>>Cost of installation is high.
>>>
>>>Performance is based on the single concentrator i.e. hub.
>
>**Bus Topology**
>>A network type in which every computer and network device is connected to single cable. It transmits the data from one end to another in single direction.
>>No bi-directional feature is in bus topology.
>>
>>ADVANTAGE
>>>Cables required to connect them is 1 i.e.- backbone cable and N drop lines are required
>>>
>>>Cost of the cable is less - it is used to built small networks
>>
>>DISADVANT
>>>If the common cable fails, then the whole system will crash down.
>>>
>>>If the network traffic is heavy, it increases collisions in the network.
>>>>To avoid - various protocols are used in MAC layer known as Pure Aloha, Slotted Aloha, CSMA/CD etc.
>
>**Ring Topology**
>>It forms a ring connecting devices with its exactly two neighboring devices.
>>> Number of repeaters are used for Ring topology with a large number of nodes -bcoz because if someone wants to send some data to the last node in the ring topology with 100 nodes, then the data will have to pass through 99 nodes to reach the 100th node. Hence to prevent data loss repeaters are used in the network.
>>
>>The transmission is unidirectional, but it can be made bidirectional by having 2 connections between each Network Node, it is called **Dual Ring Topology**
>>
>> Operations:
>>>1. One station is known as monitor station which takes all the responsibility to perform the operations.
>>>
>>>2. To transmit the data, station has to hold the token. After the transmission is done, the token is to be released for other stations to use.
>>>
>>>3. When no station is transmitting the data, then the token will circulate in the ring.
>>>
>>>4. There are two types of token release techniques :
>>>> **Early token** release releases the token just after the transmitting the data 
>>>>
>>>>**Delay token** release releases the token after the acknowledgement is received from the receiver
>>
>>ADVANTAGE
>>>The possibility of collision is minimum
>>>
>>>Cheap to install and expand.
>>
>>DISADVANT
>>>Troubleshooting is difficult in this topology.
>>>
>>>Addition of stations in between or removal of stations can disturb the whole topology.
>
>**Tree Topology / Hierarchical Topology**
>>This topology is the variation of Star topology. This topology have hierarchical flow of data.
>>
>>The various secondary hubs are connected to the central hub which contains the repeater. In this data flow from top to bottom or from bottom to top
>>
>>ADVANTAGE:
>>>It allows more devices to be attached to a single central hub
>>>
>>>It allows the network to get isolate and also prioritize from different computers.
>>
>>DISADVANT:
>>>If the central hub gets fails the entire system fails.
>>>
>>>The cost is high because of cabling.
