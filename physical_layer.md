***Types of area networks:***
>**Local Area Network (LAN)**
>>The group of computers and devices are connected together by a switch, or stack of switches, using a private addressing scheme as defined by the TCP/IP protocol. 
>>
>>Routers are found at the boundary of a LAN, connecting them to the larger WAN.
>>
>>Data transmits at a very fast rate as the number of computers linked are limited.Early LAN’s had data rates in the 4 to 16 Mbps range. Today, speeds are normally 100 or 1000 Mbps.
>>
>>The connections must be high speed and relatively inexpensive hardware
>>
>>LANs cover smaller geographical area (Size is limited to a few kilometers) and are privately owned. It covers a short distance, and so the error and noise are minimized.
>>
>>LAN is easy to design and maintain.
>>
>>A Communication medium used for LAN has twisted pair cables and coaxial cables
>>
>>The smallest LAN may only use two computers, while larger LANs can accommodate thousands of computers.
>>
>>A LAN typically relies mostly on wired connections for increased speed and security, but wireless connections can also be part of a LAN.
>>
>>The fault tolerance of a LAN is more and there is less congestion in this network.
>>
>**Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**
>>covers a larger area than that of a LAN and smaller area as compared to WAN
>>
>>Connects two or more computers that are apart but resides in the same or different cities. It covers a large geographical area and may serve as an ISP (Internet Service Provider).
>>
>>Is designed for customers who need a high-speed connectivity.Speeds of MAN ranges in terms of Mbps.
>>
>>It’s hard to design and maintain a Metropolitan Area Network.
>>
>>It is costly and may or may not be owned by a single organization
>>
>>The data transfer rate and the propagation delay of MAN is moderate.
>>
>>Devices used for transmission of data through MAN are: Modem and Wire/Cable.
>>
>>The fault tolerance of a MAN is less and also there is more congestion in the network.
>>
>**Wide Area Network (WAN)**
>>Computer network that extends over a large geographical area, although it might be confined within the bounds of a state or country.
>>
>>A WAN could be a connection of LAN connecting to other LAN’s 
>>
>>The technology is high speed and relatively expensive.
>>
>>Types of WAN:
>>>Switched WAN
>>>
>>>Point-to-Point WAN
>>
>>Difficult to design and maintain.
>>
>>The fault tolerance of a WAN is less and there is more congestion in the network
>>
>>Communication medium -  PSTN or Satellite Link.
>>
>>Due to long distance transmission, the noise and error tend to be more in WAN.
>>
>>WAN’s data rate is slow about a 10th LAN’s speed, speed ranges from few Kbps to Mbps
>>
>>Propagation delay is one of the biggest problems faced here
>>
>>Devices used for transmission of data through WAN are: Optic wires, Microwaves and Satellites.
>
>**PAN (Personal Area Network)**
>>A personal area network (PAN) is a computer network organized around an individual for personal use only. They typically involve a computer, phone, printer, tablet, or some other device like a PDA.
>>
>>they transmit information between devices that are nearby instead of sending that same data through a LAN or WAN before it reaches something that's already within reach.
>>
>>Personal area networks can be wireless or constructed with cables.
>>
>>Wireless personal area networks cover a range of a few centimeters up to around 10 meters (33 feet) / With Bluetooth, such a setup could be as large as 100 meters (330 feet). These networks are a particular type (or subset) of local area networks that support one person instead of a group.
>>
>>PANs can still access the internet under certain conditions. For example, a device within a PAN can connect to a LAN which has access to the internet, which is itself a WAN.
>>
>>a WPAN is considered a secure network. However, just like with WLANs and other network types, hackers can still access unsecured PANs.

>**SAN (Storage Area Network)**
>
>**EPN (Enterprise Private Network)**
>
>**VPN (Virtual Private Network)**

***Ad Hoc network (connection within 100 meters)***
>An ad hoc network is one that is spontaneously formed when devices connect and communicate with each other. / connection is temporary.(temporary type of Local Area Network (LAN)-f you set up an ad hoc network permanently, it becomes a LAN.)
>
>In ad hoc mode, you can set up a wireless connection directly to another computer or device without having to connect to a Wi-Fi access point or router.
>
>Users can also employ an ad hoc network to access the internet, as long as the hosting device can access the internet. This might be useful if only one small area of a location can access the internet, but multiple people need to get online.
>
>Due to the nature of an ad hoc connection not needing an existing infrastructure to sustain the network, it's entirely decentralized and is considered a peer-to-peer network.
>>If cyber-attackers get within signal range, they will generally be able to connect to a wireless ad hoc network and, therefore, to the device.
>>
>>Users cannot disable their SSID broadcast ( Service Set Identifier-function which is performed by Access Point that broadcasts its name by default /SSID basically indicates the name of your router or network) in ad hoc mode, meaning that the network name cannot be hidden if users are in a public place.
>
>Ad hoc networks can be classified into several types depending upon the nature of their applications.
>>1. Mobile ad hoc network (MANETs) ( wireless adhoc network / adhoc wireless network)
>>> Consist of set of mobile nodes connected wirelessly in a self configured, self healing network without having a fixed infrastructure. MANET nodes are free to move randomly as the network topology changes frequently.
>>
>>2. Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs)
>>>Enable effective communication with another vehicle or with the roadside equipments.Intelligent vehicular ad hoc networks(InVANETs) deals with another vehicle or with the roadside euipments.
>>
>>3. Smart phone ad hoc networks (SPANs)
>>>To create peer-to-peer network without relying on cellular carrier networks, wireless access points or traditional network infrasture.Here peer can join or leave the network without destroying it.
>>
>>4. Internet based Mobile Ad hoc Network (iMANETs) –
>>>It supports internet protocols such as TCP/UDP and IP. To link mobile nodes and establish routes distributed and automatically.
>>
>>5. Military or Tactical MANETs –
>>>This is used by the military units. Emphasis on data rate, real time demand, fast re-routing during mobility, security, radio range, etc.
>>
>>6. Flying Ad hoc Network (FANETs) –
>>>This is composed of unmanned aerial vehicle (commonly known as drone). Provides links to remote areas and mobility.

What's the difference between a Personal Area Network (PAN) and an ad-hoc network?

From memory. A PAN is more like Bluetooth, short range low bandwidth network capable of connecting your mobile or laptop to printers, speakers and such. An ad hoc network usually refers to the 802.11 wireless networks where an endpoint can host the network instead of the more typical access point / wireless router. When I set my mobile phone to hotspot mode it becomes an ad hoc wireless network provider. My computer can connect to the hot spot via WiFi or via Bluetooth.

***Types of Network Topology***
>Refers to the layout af a computer network.
>>Physical topology : layout of the network media that shows the interconnections of the devices on the network.
>>
>>Logical topology : emphasis on the manner in which data is transmitted between network nodes.
>
>**Mesh Topology**
>>In mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via particular channel.
>>
>>Ports that is required by each device is : N-1
>>
>>Total number of dedicated links required to connect them is : n to C to 2 i.e. N(N-1)/2
>>
>>ADVANTAGES:

>>>
>>>Suitable for less number of devices
>>>
>>>Cost of maintenance is high.
>
>**Star Topology**
>>All the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable.This hub is the central node and all others nodes are connected to the central node.
>>
>> No of ports: 1 per device
>>
>>Dedicated links : 1 per device
>>
>>Passive : not intelligent hub such as broadcasting devices.
>>
>>Active : the hub can be intelligent. Active hubs have repeaters in them.
>>

>
>**Bus Topology**
>>A network type in which every computer and network device is connected to single cable. It transmits the data from one end to another in single direction.
>>No bi-directional feature is in bus topology.
>>
>>ADVANTAGE
>>>Cables required to connect them is 1 i.e.- backbone cable and N drop lines are required

>>
>>DISADVANT
>>>If the common cable fails, then the whole system will crash down.

>>>>To avoid - various protocols are used in MAC layer known as Pure Aloha, Slotted Aloha, CSMA/CD etc.
>
>**Ring Topology**
>>It forms a ring connecting devices with its exactly two neighboring devices.
>>> Number of repeaters are used for Ring topology with a large number of nodes -bcoz because if someone wants to send some data to the last node in the ring topology with 100 nodes, then the data will have to pass through 99 nodes to reach the 100th node. Hence to prevent data loss repeaters are used in the network.
>>

**Quick View of Ethernet Cables Cat5, Cat5e And Cat6 / twisted-pair copper cables**

>**Cat 5**
>>Category 5 (Cat5) has four twisted pairs of copper wire terminated by RJ45 connector.
>>Category 5 cable has a bandwidth of up to 100 MHz, support 10 or 100 Mbps speed.
>>Cables belonging to Category 5 are either solid or stranded:
>>>Solid Cat 5 is more rigid, and the better choice if data needs to be transmitted over a long distance
>>>Stranded Cat 5 is very flexible and most likely to be used as patch cable the maximum length (maximum certifiable length) for Cat 5 patch or crossover cables is 100 meters.
>>
>>Used for ATM, taken ring, Ethernet 1000Base-T, 100Bast-T, and 10Base-T networking

>**Cat 5e**
>>Enhanced version of Category 5 cable
>>Cat5e speed can reach up to 1000 Mbps "gigabit"
>>Used in the home networking environment with various lengths.

>**Cat 6**
>>Made with 23guage conductor wire as opposed to the slightly smaller 24guage for Cat5e.
>>It also has a separator to handle crosstalk better.
>>This separator isolates each of the four pairs of twisted wire from the others, which reduces crosstalk, allows for faster data transfer, and gives Cat6 bandwidth twice than that of Cat 5
>>Cat6 cable is ideal for supporting 10 Gigabit Ethernet speed, and is able to operate at up to 250MHz.
**
 * **Cat5 vs Cat5e Cable**
The differences between Cat5 and Cat5e show in all aspects of performance: network support, cross talk and bandwidth. Cat5e internet cable supports Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, and Gigabit Ethernet speed while Cat5 cable speed just supports the former two. CAT5e cable patch is completely backwards compatible, and can be used in any application in which you would normally use CAT 5 cable. In addition, cross talk has been reduced greatly in Cat5e cabling compared with Cat5 cable. Besides, Cat5e is rated at 350Mhz, which allows it support increased bandwidth than Cat5.

 * **Cat5e vs Cat6 Cable**
The general difference between category 5e and category 6 is in the transmission performance. While Cat5e can support gigabit speeds, Cat6 is certified to handle gigabit Ethernet. Additionally, the Cat6 specification is better suited toward environments that are generally unfriendly to twisted pair cabling. This includes areas that have lots of interference from things like power lines, lights, and manufacturing equipment. Still, for most applications, Cat5e is perfectly suitable and preferable to Cat6: it is more economical and performs almost as well. However, if you can be certain that all the components on your network are gigabit rated, and the volume of the data being transmitted calls for certified gigabit performance, then Cat6 is the way to go.

**Design issues for Layers**

>* Reliability
>>Network channels and components may be unreliable, resulting in loss of bits while data transfer. So, an important design issue is to make sure that the information transferred is not distorted.

>* Scalability
>>Networks are continuously evolving. The sizes are continually increasing leading to congestion. Also, when new technologies are applied to the added components, it may lead to incompatibility issues. Hence, the design should be done so that the networks are scalable and can accommodate such additions and alterations.

>* Addressing
>>At a particular time, innumerable messages are being transferred between large numbers of computers. So, a naming or addressing system should exist so that each layer can identify the sender and receivers of each message.

>* Error Control
>>Unreliable channels introduce a number of errors in the data streams that are communicated. So, the layers need to agree upon common error detection and error correction methods so as to protect data packets while they are transferred.

>* Flow Control
>>If the rate at which data is produced by the sender is higher than the rate at which data is received by the receiver, there are chances of overflowing the receiver. So, a proper flow control mechanism needs to be implemented.

>* Resource Allocation
>>Computer networks provide services in the form of network resources to the end users. The main design issue is to allocate and deallocate resources to processes. The allocation/deallocation should occur so that minimal interference among the hosts occurs and there is optimal usage of the resources.

>* Statistical Multiplexing
>>It is not feasible to allocate a dedicated path for each message while it is being transferred from the source to the destination. So, the data channel needs to be multiplexed, so as to allocate a fraction of the bandwidth or time to each host.

>* Routing
>>There may be multiple paths from the source to the destination. Routing involves choosing an optimal path among all possible paths, in terms of cost and time. There are several routing algorithms that are used in network systems.

>* Security
>>A major factor of data communication is to defend it against threats like eavesdropping and surreptitious alteration of messages. So, there should be adequate mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to data through authentication and cryptography.
